RTOSIM
======

RTOSIM is a set of efficient and extensible C++ libraries to connect
OpenSim with different devices. RTOSIM can use data provided by motion
capture systems to solve OpenSim inverse kinematics and inverse
dynamics on a frame-by-frame basis. Multiple threads operate
concurrently to remove idle times due to communications with input and
output devices, and the data flow is automatically managed by RTOSIM
in order to preserve data integrity and avoid race conditions.

Dependencies
------------
RTOSIM depends on the following

* Cross-platform building: [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) 2.8.8 or later
* Compiler:
* [Visual Studio](http://www.visualstudio.com) 2013 or later (Windows only)
* [gcc](http://gcc.gnu.org/) 4.8.1 or later (typically on Linux)
* [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org/) 3.4 or later (typically on Mac, possibly through Xcode)
* Required external libraries:
* [Simbody](https://github.com/simbody/simbody/tree/Simbody-3.5.3) versions 3.5.1 to 3.5.3
* [OpenSim](https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-core/tree/v3.2.0/OpenSim) versions 3.2 or 3.3
* Optional external libraries:
* [Vicon DataStream SDK](http://www.vicon.com/downloads) version 1.5+


Install
-------

RTOSIM works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Binary packages will be
available for Windows.

Build
-----

1. Get and compile
[Simbody](https://github.com/simbody/simbody/tree/Simbody-3.5.3). **IMPORTANT**:
if you want to use multiple threads to solve the Inverse Kinematics it
is necessary to first [patch Simbody](#patch-simbody).
2. Get and compile
   [OpenSim](https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-core/tree/v3.2.0/OpenSim)
3. If you want to enable the real-time stream from Vicon Nexus you
   need to download and install [Vicon DataStream
   SDK](http://www.vicon.com/downloads)
* Add the environmental variable VICONDATASTREAM\_INSTALL\_DIR that points to the installation directory of the Vicon DataStream SDK (must contain the file Client.h), as example
c:\Program Files (x86)\Vicon\DataStream SDK\Win32\CPP
4. Build your project using CMake.
5. Run the examples using the [test data](#test-data).

Patch Simbody
-------------

If you want to use multiple threads to solve the OpenSim inverse
kinematics using IpOpt as optimisation algorithm (which is the default
algorithm for constrained optimisations in OpenSim), you need to patch
Simbody first. To do this, get the files
[IpLapackSolverInterface.cpp](https://github.com/cpizzolato/simbody/blob/fix-ipopt-issue175/SimTKmath/Optimizers/src/IpOpt/IpLapackSolverInterface.cpp)
and
[IpLapackSolverInterface.hpp](https://github.com/cpizzolato/simbody/blob/fix-ipopt-issue175/SimTKmath/Optimizers/src/IpOpt/IpLapackSolverInterface.hpp)
and use them to replace the corresponding files in your Simbody
distribution in the directory SimTKmath/Optimizers/src/IpOpt. Then,
compile and install Simbody.

Test Data
---------

Get the [test
data](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzMAK5L0QV2PUXk4SW9qcV9jSVU)

1. Using text files (you may need to adapt the commands to your
   directory structure):
* `rtosim_ik_from_file` solves the inverse kinematics from marker
  trajectory (.trc) files.
* Example of use: `rtosim_ik_from_file --model
  rtosim-testdata/models/2392_scaled_clusters.osim --trc
  rtosim-testdata/unfilteredRawData/walking/walking.trc --task-set
  rtosim-testdata/setup/walking/ik_taskset.xml -v`
* `rtosim_id_from_file` solves the inverse dynamics from a motion
(.mot) file and from ground reaction forces (.mot). This example
functions similarly to the OpenSim inverse dynamics tool.  The joint
angles are filtered (not in real-time) by `rtosim_id_from_file`, while
the ground reaction forces have to be pre-filtered.
* Example of use: `rtosim_id_from_file --model
  rtosim-testdata/models/2392_scaled_clusters.osim --mot
  rtosim-testdata/filteredData8Hz/walking/walking.mot --ext-loads
  rtosim-testdata/setup/walking/externalLoads.xml`
* `rtosim_ik_id_from_file` solves inverse kinematics and inverse
  dynamics from raw marker trajectories and raw ground reaction
  forces. It works in the same way as `rtosim_ik_id_from_nexus` but
  uses files as input.
* Example of use: `rtosim_ik_id_from_file --model
  rtosim-testdata/models/2392_scaled_clusters.osim --trc
  rtosim-testdata/unfilteredRawData/walking/walking.trc --task-set
  rtosim-testdata/setup/walking/ik_taskset.xml --ext-loads
  rtosim-testdata/setup/walking/externalLoads.xml -v`

2. Using Vicon Nexus:
* You need to have RTOSIM, Vicon Nexus (tested with version 2.2.3),
  Vicon Virtual System (version 1.3.2+). and Vicon DataStream SDK
  (version 1.5+) installed on your system.
* Open Vicon Nexus, and navigate to the directory viconRawData
  provided in the test data.
* The subject tab of Vicon Nexus should automatically populate
* Press the 'Go Live' button to enter in live mode. This is the mode
  used to recorda data during an acquisition.
* Open Vicon Virtual System and load the files walking.x1d and
  walking.x2d
* Press the 'Stream' button in Vicon Virtual System to start streaming
  the raw data to Vicon Nexus
* Markers should appear in Vicon Nexus. Markers should be correctly
  autolabelled in real-time
* Be sure you can see the ground reaction forces during the stance
phases. If not, check that the force plates correctly appear unser the
menu Device. Also, under the source menu, check that the force plates,
which names are `#1 Right` and `#2 Left` are connected to `#2 MX
Giganet - Slot 1`
* Execute the example file rtosim\_ik\_id\_from\_nexus (you need to
  adapt the command to your directory structure)

` rtosim_ik_id_from_nexus --model
rtosim-testdata/models/2392_scaled_clusters.osim --task-set
rtosim-testdata/setup/walking/ik_taskset.xml --ext-loads
rtosim-testdata/setup/walking/externalLoads_nexus.xml -v `

* To close the execution of RTOSIM press any key followed by `enter`
* For the available options execute `rtosim_ik_id_from_nexus -h`

Adapt the software for your gait laboratory
-------------------------------------------

The representation of force plates moments in the version of Vicon
Nexus used to test RTOSIM is not what you may expect. To have the
correct representation of joint moments in the global reference system
of the gait laboratory is necessary to perform a further
transformation. This requires to know the position of the force
plates. You can get this by opening Vicon Nexus, clicking on your
force plate -> Show Advanced -> Position. Currently, these values are
harcoded in RTOSIM for the Griffith University gait
laboratory. However, what you have to do to adapt it to your lab is to
modify the function `DataFromNexus::getForcePlatePosition() const`
with your force plates position. **IMPORTANT**: the position of the
force plates must be consistent with the rotation used in the function
`DataFromNexus::setAxisMapping(VDS::Client& client) const`. You need
to provide the position of the force plate **already rotated**.
